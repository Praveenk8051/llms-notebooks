The buzzword is everywhere and people are wondering what is NFT and what is its use? Well, there is not really a one-line explainer.

NFT stands for Non-fungible Token. Fungible by its very definition means something that is mutually interchangeable. For example, you can exchange a $10 note with another $10 note or exchange it with two $5 notes. In both cases, the value remains the same and you will have no problem exchanging the money. Here, money is a fungible item as it can be exchanged without diminishing the value.'),\n",

We have explained NFTs, and tell you how you can buy, make and sell your own NFTs easily.', 'language': 'en-US'}, page_content='So when we say Non-fungible, it means something that can’t be exchanged with a similar item of similar value. To give you a simple example, if you want to replace the Mona Lisa painting kept in Louvre, Paris with another printout of the same image, will it be the same? And more importantly, will it hold the same value? The answer is no. Here, the incomparable Mona Lisa painting is a Non-fungible item that can’t be exchanged with another item having an identical appearance.'),\n",

We have explained NFTs, and tell you how you can buy, make and sell your own NFTs easily.', 'language': 'en-US'}, page_content='Uniqueness is the key here. A Non-fungible item is, therefore, something that is unique and authentic. Something that holds value for its authenticity. Now we come to the token part. A token is a 40-digit string of words and numbers that hold the information of the original artist who created the masterpiece, the current owner of the item (it can only be one), and the current price of the item. This storage of information is backed by Blockchain technology which can’t be altered by any means due to its decentralized system.\\n\\nFinally, when you put all three words together, NFT means an incorruptible token that holds ownership information about an item that is unique and authentic. NFT is basically a certificate of ownership or authenticity. This is the general definition of NFT, but if you want to get a complete idea about NFTs then you need to understand the concept with digital art as an example, which I have covered in the next section.\\n\\nWhat is the Use of NFT in Digital Art?'),\n",

Well, as I explained in the above section that NFT is a signature of authenticity and it provides that authentic stamp of approval on the web while dealing with digital arts. We all know, in today’s world anything can be tampered with and people can pass off others’ work as theirs. Basically, on the web, it’s next to impossible to find the original creator of an artwork and that’s where NFTs come into the play. NFTs pretty much aim to bring art collecting into the digital age with completely digital art that is sold as NFTs.'),\n",

Subsequent to that, Ethereum brought ERC-1155 and advanced the technology before Bitcoin and Flow could catch up.\\n\\nIn what was the first introduction of NFT to the masses, in 2017, Ethereum introduced a blockchain game called CryptoKitties. In this game, players could purchase, collect, breed, and sell virtual cats using Ether (Ethereum’s cryptocurrency). At that time, the highest-selling cat was sold at $117,712 which was mind-boggling. Getting a cue, Ethereum incorporated the NFT system into its cryptocurrency and now they are leading the market.'),\n",

First off, it takes up an enormous amount of energy to generate and maintain the system which makes it unsustainable and makes a negative impact on the ecology. It’s because, unlike cryptocurrency, a non-fungible token runs on a proof-of-work blockchain which is less energy-efficient. As an aside, expect GPU prices to go even higher in the near future due to extreme mining.'),\n",

Experts say that paintings and rare collectibles do not hold value just because of the sheer artistry, but also because there is an established audience who want to own and collect rare paintings or an artwork that no other person has.\\n\\nExperts point out that those who are buying digital artwork are not paying huge sums because they appreciate art. Instead, they want to create a bubble to earn money by reselling it at a higher price. It’s worth noting that the digital world does not have a scarcity of artwork — unlike physical masterpieces — so the prices will likely come down once the bubble bursts.\\n\\nHow to Buy NFTs\\n\\nBuying an NFT is as simple as heading to any of the NFT marketplaces, and making a purchase.

It also learns from your interactions and becomes more accurate over time. With this ChatGPT tool baked into the command line, users don’t have to type long commands or remember complicated Linux Terminal commands. They can save valuable time while minimizing errors, getting ChatGPT to do some of their menial work for them.'),\n",

In fact, ChatGPT is also built using Python along with other languages. Generally, Python comes preinstalled on most latest Linux distros. So first, check the python version installed on your Linux PC with this command:\\n\\npython3 --version\\n\\nIf the above command outputs any errors, it means python is not installed or the deprecated python2.7 is installed on your system.

The df stands for “Disk Filesystem” in the command, which is a handy way to check the current disk usage and the available disk space in Linux. The syntax for the df command in Linux is as follows:\\n\\ndf <options> <file_system>\\n\\nThe options to use with the df command are:\\n\\nOptions Description -a Show information about all file systems including pseudo, duplicate and inaccessible file systems -h Display the sizes in human-readable format i.e in powers of 1024 -t Display the disk usage of only the file system of a particular type -x Display the disk usage excluding a particular file type\\n\\nDisplay Disk Usage in Human Readable Format'),\n",

To see file sizes in a human-readable format such as megabytes, gigabytes, etc., then use the -h flag.Here’s what the syntax looks like:\\n\\ndf -h\\n\\nDisplay Disk Occupancy of a Particular Type\\n\\nYou can also view the disk usage of a particular file system type using the -t flag as shown below:\\n\\ndf -t <file_system_type>\\n\\nCheck Disk Usage using the du Command\\n\\nThe df command only shows the disk usage for the entire file system and not for individual files and directories. To view the disk usage for individual files and directories, use the du command. Here, du stands for “disk usage“. The syntax to use the du command is:\\n\\ndu <option> <file>\\n\\nThe options to use with the du command are:\\n\\nOptions Description -a Shows details of all files -h Shows the file sizes in human-readable format -s Displays the size of a particular directory -c Shows the total usage of the entire directory'),\n",

But you can view the disk usage for a specific folder, using the -s flag with the basic command as under:\\n\\ndu -s -h <directory_name>\\n\\nCompare Disk Usage of Two Directories\\n\\nWith the du command, you can also compare the disk usage of two or more directories as shown below:\\n\\ndu <options> <directory_1> <directory_2>\\n\\nClean Disk Space Using the Command Line\\n\\nYou can use either of the du and the df commands in combination with other Linux commands to list out the files and directories occupying the most space.

The syntax to use both commands is:\\n\\ndu -a <directory_path> | sort -rn\\n\\nHere, the pipe character ‘|‘ is used to send the output of one command as the input for another command. In the second part of the syntax, the -r flag is used to sort in reverse order and the -n flag is used to sort files based on the numeric value.

The syntax to use the --exclude flag with the du command is:\\n\\ndu -h <path_to_directory> --exclude=\"*<file_extension>\"\\n\\nHere, the * is used as a wild card which signifies that all the characters should match the input while parsing the directory.\\n\\nCheck Disk Usage Using GUI'),\n",
